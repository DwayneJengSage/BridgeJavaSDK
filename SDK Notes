study -> user -> user_data

User is going to sign up, providing an email address, username, and password.
Bridge sends consent link to that email address.
User is signed in, and walks through consent process.
User finishes consent process, and sends consent signature.
User is forwarded to the main site, where they are authenticated and consented.
User goes through a series of actions, and then wants to sign out.

SDK, standard development kit.
Authentication, how does this work? User signs in, out, up, and requests a password reset.
