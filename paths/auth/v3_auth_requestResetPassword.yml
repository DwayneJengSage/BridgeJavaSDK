        Does not require authentication. Will send an email with a link that contains the session 
        token necessary to reset the password (cannot be done through the API alone). If the user 
        account does not exist, this method will still return 200 in order to prevent "account 
        enumeration" security breaches.
    parameters:
        - name: Email
          in: body
          description: Email information 
          required: true
          schema:
                $ref: '../../definitions/email.yml'
    responses:
