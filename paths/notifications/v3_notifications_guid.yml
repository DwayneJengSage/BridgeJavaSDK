    operationId: updateNotificationRegistration
    summary: Update a push notification registration
    description: |
        Update an existing device registration with a new token that has been assigned by the 
        client operating system. At least on iOS, the device token can change over the lifetime of 
        the app, and it is considered best practice to re-send this token to the server on every 
        start-up of the app. The guid returned should be the same as the GUID that was used to 
        submit the update.
