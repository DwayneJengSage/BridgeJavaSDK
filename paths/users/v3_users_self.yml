        Returns a user profile object that is a subset of the study participant record (which has superceded 
        the profile along with a new set of APIs, see `/v3/participants/self`). Updating the profile will 
        update the participant record, and vice versa. The user does *not* have to be consented to the study 
        to retrieve or update the study profile (just as a user may submit updates to the study participant at sign up).
