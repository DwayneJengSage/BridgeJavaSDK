    For studies that wish to orchestrate an agreement to participate prior to signing up for a study, this API provides a way to store a consent under a phone number or email address. The user must submit a phone number *or* an email address (not both) as part of this submission, the same credential that will be used to sign up for the study. On first sign in, instead of receiving a 412 response, this user will be consented with this intent to participate record.
