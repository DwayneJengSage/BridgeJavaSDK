    For studies that wish to orchestrate an agreement to participate prior to signing up for a study, this API provides a way to store a consent under a phone number. The user must submit a phone number or email (not both) as part of this submission, the same credential that will be used to sign up for the study. On first sign in, instead of receiving a 412 response, this user will be consented with this intent to participate.
