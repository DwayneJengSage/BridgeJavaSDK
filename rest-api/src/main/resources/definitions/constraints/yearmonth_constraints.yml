              Should this question allow answers in the future? If the current date falls 
              in a month after the indicated month, it is considered to be in the future.

              ISO 8601 year and month value ("YYYY-MM") that is the earliest value that may be set 
              for this question.  If allowFuture is false, that constraint should also be applied 
              regardless of earliest/latestValue constraints.
