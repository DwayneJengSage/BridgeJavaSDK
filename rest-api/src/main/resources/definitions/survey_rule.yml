    An information screen or question may have one or more rules in an array:
    * Rules are evaluated before the screen is display, and afterward after the user answers a question, or triggers navigation away from the screen through a `next` or `decline to answer` response;
    * Rules are evaluated against the user's answer to the question (using the `value` property) or against  the user's assigned data groups (using the `dataGroups` property);
    * If a rule matches, the action for that rule should be followed (e.g. showing a different question than the next question in the list, or ending the survey);
    * Rule actions will specify whether or not further rules in the list should be evaluated (navigation rules end evaluation, while other actions do not); 
    * If a question allows multiple answers to be submitted, the rule expression matches the rule if *any* of the submitted answers match the rule;
    * If there are no rules, or no rule matches, proceed to the next question in the list.
 
    One and only one action should be provided in the rule: `skipTo`, `endSurvey`, `assignDataGroup`,
    `displayIf`, or `displayOnly`.
type: object
required:
    - operator
    - value
    - dataGroups
properties:
    operator:
        $ref: ./enums/operator.yml
    value:
        type: string
        description: |
            The answer submitted by the user to the question. This value will be tested against the 
            rule expression (the value is always expressed as  a string, regardless of the 
            question's data type). For example, a rule with value="10",  operator=eq, indicates that 
            the survey rule expression will be true if the user's answer is equal to 10.
    dataGroups:
        type: array
        items:
            type: string
        description: |
            Some operators will test a set of data groups against the user's set of data groups. 
            The operators `any` and `all` make a comparison of the sets in this property against 
            the user's data groups.
    skipTo:
        type: string
        description: |
            The property will reference an identifier for a question in the survey. If specified, and 
            the rule's expression is true, stop evaluating survey rules and display that question 
            next. Progress through the survey should proceed from that question in the list. The target 
            question should be after the current question in the survey.
    endSurvey:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            If specified, and the rule's expression is true, immediately stop evaluating rules and end 
            the survey. The users existing answers to the survey should be sent to the server.
    displayIf:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Before rules only.** If the rule expression is true, display this question or information 
            screen.
    displayUnless:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Before rules only.** If the rule expression is true, do not display this question or 
            information. Put differently, show the screen unless the expression is true.
    assignDataGroup:
        type: string
        description: |
            If specified, the value is a data group that should be added to the survey taker if the 
            rule expression is true, or removed if the rule expression is false. Survey rules 
            that specify `assignDataGroup` do not end evaluation of rules in the list; the engine 
            should proceed to evaluate and apply the next rule in the list. The changes to the user's 
            data groups should not be applied if the user cancels the survey.
