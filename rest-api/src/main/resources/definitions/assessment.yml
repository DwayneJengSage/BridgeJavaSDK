            A map of AssessmentNode GUIDs to a set of field identifiers in that node that can be customized by developers without invalidating an assessment (the assessment will maintain its link to the shared assessment it was derived from, if any, and the authors of the assessment are confident that these changes to the configuration will not invalidate the scientific validity of the assessment). This specification guides validation of submissions to update an AssessmentNode through a specific customization API.

If it does not match the value on the server, a 409 error (Conflict) will prevent the update from occurring. It can also serve as a key to determine if a local cache of `Assessment` needs to be updated.
