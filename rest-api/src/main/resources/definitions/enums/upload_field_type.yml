type: string
description: |
    This class is unusual in the API in that the `type` attribute is not a constant `UploadFieldDefinition` string, it 
    is one of the enumerated values and indicates the type of the field, not the type of the model object:

    |Type|Description|
    |---|---|
    |attachment_v2|Attachment. When selected, `fileExtension` and `mimeType` can refine the field definition|
    |boolean|Boolean|
    |calendar_date|Date (no time of day)|
    |timestamp|Date &amp; Time (a timestamp)|
    |float|Decimal|
    |inline_json_blob|Writes a small JSON blob inline into the health data table.|
    |int|Integer|
    |large_text_attachment|A value that is written to Synapse as a LargeText (unbounded String), but stored in Bridge as an attachment.|
    |multi_choice|A JSON array of strings, representing answers to a multiple choice question that allows multiple selections.|
    |single_choice|A string representing the answer to a multiple choice question that allows only a single selection.|
    |string|String. When selected, `maxLength` and `unboundedText` can refine the field definition|
    |time_v2|Time of Day (no date or timezone)|
