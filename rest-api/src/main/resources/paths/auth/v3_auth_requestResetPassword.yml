        Does not require authentication. Will send an email or SMS message with a confirmation token 
        that can be used by the client to verify the credential. In the case of the email message, 
        and URL is included by default that loads a web page which will complete the confirmation. If 
        the user account does not exist, this method will still return 200 in order to prevent "account 
        enumeration" security breaches.
