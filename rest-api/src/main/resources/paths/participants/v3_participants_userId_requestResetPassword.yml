    summary: Trigger a request to reset password for this user
    description: |
        When called, a reset password message will be sent to either the email address or the phone number for this account (preferencing the email address). The user account does not have to be active for a researcher to trigger a reset password message on their behalf. The act of resetting the password successfully will activate the account and verify the credential used to send the reset token (email address or phone number). This endpoint can be called by researchers, and by other administrators for their own account record.
