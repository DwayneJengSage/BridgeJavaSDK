    summary: Withdraw the participant from all studies in this app
    description: |
        Withdraw the user entirely from all studies in this app. The user is withdraw from all consents, no further data will be exported from Bridge, the device will be unregistered from any push notifications, and the account's identifiers (email, phone number, and external ID) will be deleted. The account remains to verify the consent history for a given health code. The app consent administration email will receive a notification of the withdrawal. This withdrawal cannot be reversed. If the user signs up again with the app, a new account under a new `healthCode` will be generated. This endpoint can be called by researchers, and by other administrators for their own account.
