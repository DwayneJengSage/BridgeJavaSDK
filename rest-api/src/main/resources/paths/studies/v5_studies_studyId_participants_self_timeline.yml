    operationId: getTimelineForSelf
    summary: Get the callerâ€™s timeline of scheduled assessments in this study. Note that this endpoint supports the return of `Not Modified` responses, if the client provides an `If-Modified-Since` header in their request. Timelines rarely change and can be large, though they are sent compressed by the server and usually compress well for transfer.
