    summary: Notify Bridge an upload is complete
    description: |
        Notify Bridge an upload is complete. Either a consented user or a worker 
        process can access this endpoing, but failure to have the worker role will 
        be treated like a consent error.

        In synchronous mode, this API will poll until upload validation is complete (or failed or is otherwise in a
        non-transient state), and return the upload validation status. In asynchronous mode, this API will return
        immediately and will also return the upload validation status, which is likely to be in
        "validation_in_progress".
