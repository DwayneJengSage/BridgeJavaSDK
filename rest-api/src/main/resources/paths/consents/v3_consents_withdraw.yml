    summary: Withdraw user from study
    description: |
        Withdraw the user entirely from this study. The user is withdraw from all consents, no further data will be exported from Bridge, the device will be unregistered from any push notifications, and the account's identifiers (email, phone number, and external ID) will be deleted. The account remains to verify the consent history for a given health code. The study consent administration email will receive a notification of the withdrawal. Finally, the user will be signed out from the Bridge server. This withdrawal cannot be reversed. If the user signs up again with the study, a new account under a new `healthCode` will be generated.
