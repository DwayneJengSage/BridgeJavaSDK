    externalId:
        type: string
        description: |
            An externally-assignable identifier a research partner can use to re-identify a user's data 
            in the exported data set (this must be provided by the application, it is not created by Bridge). 
            If external IDs are managed, this is required on creation and cannot be modified after the 
            account is created. Otherwise, it is a string that can be set to any value, changed, removed, etc.
    id:
        type: string
        readOnly: true
        description: An ID assigned to identify this user as an account in the Bridge system. This is separate 
            from the healthCode and the two are never associated in the API or the data exported from Bridge. 
            Used to retrieve study participant information through the API. 
    notifyByEmail:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: |
            True if the user has consented to be contacted via email outside the application, false otherwise.

        additionalProperties:
            type: string
        description: |
            A map of user profile attributes that have been set for this user (the attributes themselves 
            must be specified in the study's configuration, and the values are stored encrypted in case they 
            are personally-identifying information).
    sharingScope:
        type: string
        description: |
            How far does this user wish to share data?

            |Scope|Description|
            |---|---|
            |no_sharing|User does not wish to share data. Note that in some early applications, this is the equivalent of withdrawing from a study, and should be treated as such.|
            |sponsors_and_partners|Share data in data sets that are available to the study researchers and their researcher partners only.|
            |all_qualified_researchers|Share data with researchers who qualify under the specific governance qualifications to access the study's data set. These researchers may do research on new questions after the lifetime of the initial research.|
        enum:
            - no_sharing

    status:
        type: string
        description: |
            An enumeration of the status of the user's account:

            |Status|Description|
            |---|---|
            |disabled|Account has been disabled. The account appears not to exist while it is in this state. Bridge does not automatically disable accounts for any reason, but researchers can disable accounts if needed.|
            |unverified|Account has been created but the user has yet to verify the email address. The account appears not to exist while it is in this state.|
            |enabled|Account is active and usable.|

            On creation, the initial status of a user account depends on the email verification policy set 
            for the study. If verification is required, the account will be unverified until that is done; 
            otherwise it will be enabled.
        enum:
            - disabled
            - enabled
            - unverified
    roles:
        type: array
        description: |
            The roles assigned to this user. Normal study participants do not have any roles assigned, but for 
            developers, researchers, etc. their roles will appear hear (see main API documentation about the 
            roles assigned by the Bridge server).

        description: |
            Two letter language codes to assign to this user (these are initially retrieved from the 
            user's Accept-Language header, but are persisted after this as part of the user's options 
            and it can be updated later).
