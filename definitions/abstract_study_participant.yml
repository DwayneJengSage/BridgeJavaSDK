        description: |
            An externally-assignable identifier a research partner can use to re-identify a user's data 
            in the exported data set (this must be provided by the application, it is not created by Bridge). 
            If external IDs are managed, this is required on creation and cannot be modified after the 
            account is created. Otherwise, it is a string that can be set to any value, changed, removed, etc.
    id:
        type: string
        readOnly: true
        description: An ID assigned to identify this user as an account in the Bridge system. This is separate 
            from the healthCode and the two are never associated in the API or the data exported from Bridge. 
            Used to retrieve study participant information through the API.

            A map of user profile attributes that have been set for this user (the attributes themselves 
            must be specified in the study's configuration, and the values are stored encrypted in case they 
            are personally-identifying information).

            and it can be updated later).
