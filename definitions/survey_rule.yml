    A constraint may have one or more rules in an array:
    * Rules should be evaluated after a user answers a question, against the answer provided by the user;
    * they should be evaluated until one matches (then further evaluation should be aborted);
    * if a rule matches, the action for that rule should be followed (e.g. showing a different question than the next question in the list, or end the survey);
    * if a question allows multiple answers to be submitted, it matches the rule if any of the submitted answers match the rule;
    * if there are no rules or no rule matches, proceed to the next question in the list.

    Either `skipToTarget` or `endSurvey` should be supplied in the rule.

properties:
    operator:

    skipTo:
        type: string
        description: |
            The property will reference an identifier for a question in the survey. The user's next question should be that question, and progress through the survey should proceed from that question in the list. It is guaranteed that the referenced question will be after the current question in the survey.
    endSurvey:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            If present, this property must be true and no skipTo value should be provided. 
            If the rule matches, immediately end the survey. (An alternative is to have the 
            final screen of your survey be an info screen with a thank you note, and you can 
            skipTo that).
