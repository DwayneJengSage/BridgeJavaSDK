    "UploadFieldDefinition" value, it is one of the enumerated values and indicates the 
    type of the field, not the type of the model object: 
enum:
    - attachment_blob
    - attachment_csv
    - attachment_json_blob
    - attachment_json_table
    - attachment_v2
    - boolean
    - calendar_date
    - duration_v2
    - float
    - inline_json_blob
    - int
    - multi_choice
    - single_choice
    - string
    - time_v2
    - timestamp
