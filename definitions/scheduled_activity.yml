    Description of an activity (such as a task or survey) the study would like the participant to perform. 
    A scheduled activity will contain a reference to a task or survey, but not both, and the activityType 
    will reflect which property exists on the activity (e.g. if a task is defined, the activityType will be 
    "task").
