    name:
        type: string
        description: A label for the study. This will be shown to users in emails and other contexts.
    sponsorName:
        type: string
        description: The name of the institution or organization that is conducting the study. Emails will be sent "from" this entity.
    supportEmail:
        type: string
        description: |
            The email address that will be given to study participants and other end user for all support requests and queries (technical, study-related, etc.). This can be a comma-separated list of email addresses. 
    technicalEmail:
        type: string
        description: |
            The email address for a technical contact who can coordinate with the Bridge Server team on issues related either to client development or hand-offs of the study data through the Bridge server. This can be a comma-separated list of email addresses.
    consentNotificationEmail:
        type: string
        description: |
            Copies of all consent agreements, as well as rosters of all participants in a study, or any other study governance issues, will be emailed to this address. This can be a comma-separated list of email addresses.
    identifier:
        type: string
        description: |
            A user selected identifier that is unique relative to all other Bridge studies (lower-case letters and dashes only). The identifier serves as a "domain" that scopes accounts to that study, and is usually created by combining an institution and study tag or acronym. For example, if your work at the University of Washington and your study is on Asthma in Children, your identifier might be uw-child-asthma. Users will not see this identifier.
    version:
        type: integer
        description: |
            A version number used for optimistic locking of the object these keys represent; this value must be passed back to the server on subsequent updates. An error will be returned (409 Conflict) if the object has been updated since it was retrieved by this client.
    minAgeOfConsent:
        type: integer
        default: 18
        description: |
            The minimum required age for participants in the study. If the user reports they are younger than this age, they will not be allowed to consent to the research.
    synapseDataAccessTeamId:
        type: integer
        description: |
            Synapse team ID that is granted read access to exported health data records.
    synapseProjectId:
        type: integer
        description: The Synapse project to export health data records to.
    usesCustomExportSchedule:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            By default, all studies are exported using the default nightly schedule. Some studies may need custom schedules for hourly or on-demand exports. To prevent this study from being exported twice (once by the custom schedule, once by the default schedule), you should set this attribute to true.
    userProfileAttributes:
        type: array
        description: |
            Custom attributes that can be added to the StudyParticipant object (as members of the attributes property). This data can be personally identifying health information; it will be stored encrypted and in a separate data store from the participant's health data.
        items:
            type: string
    taskIdentifiers:
        type: array
        description: |
            An enumerated list of **unique** strings that can be used to identify tasks when creating schedules. These mostly serve to prevent typos when designing schedules, which would prevent client scheduling from working. There's no hard limit on the string content (e.g. "Tapping Test" is fine as a task identifier, as long as it uniquely identifies a task known to the application).
        items:
            type: string
    dataGroups:
        type: array
        description: |
            An enumerated list of **unique** strings that can be assigned to user accounts. These "tags" will be exported with a participant's health data to Synapse. This can be used to identify test users or specific cohorts in the study, but it should not include sensitive health information about participants. Strings must contain only letters, numbers, underscore or dash, and cannot (as a comma-separated list) exceed the character limit of 100 characters so they can be exported to Synapse.
        items:
            type: string
    passwordPolicy:
        description: |
            Settings that will govern what is accepted as a valid password when users sign up for the study. If not included, the password policy will default to requiring 8 characters, including lower and upper-case letters, at least one number and at least one symbol.
        $ref: ./password_policy.yml
    verifyEmailTemplate:
        description: |
            The template for emails delivered to users during sign up, asking them to verify their email address.
        $ref: ./email_template.yml
    resetPasswordTemplate:
        description: The template for emails delivered to users who ask to reset their passwords.
        $ref: ./email_template.yml
    active:
        type: boolean
    strictUploadValidationEnabled:
        description: True if uploads in this study should fail on strict validation errors.
        type: boolean
    healthCodeExportEnabled:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Admin only; read-only for developers.** Should user health codes be exported as part of the participant roster? This identifies users in the public data set; this can only be set to true for certain studies where users expect to be identified by researchers.
    emailVerificationEnabled:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Admin only; read-only for developers.** Should users be asked to validate that they control the email addresses they use to sign up for the study? True by default.
    externalIdValidationEnabled:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            Should external identifiers be validated? If this is false, then the external ID is treated as an unconstrained string. If this is true, the study designer will need to enter the list of valid codes into Bridge. Bridge will ensure that the following is true:

            * If assigned, the ID will have to match one of the IDs entered into Bridge;
            * A given ID will be assigned to one and only one user
            * Once assigned, it is not possible to change or remove the external ID from the user account
    minSupportedAppVersions:
        type: object
        description: |
            Minimum supported app versions (older versions will be blocked), keyed by the 
            name of the operating system (we expect either "Android" or "iPhone OS" in the 
            User-Agent header of all requests sent to the server). Example: `{"iPhone OS":14,"Android":10}`
