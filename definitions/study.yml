    name:
        type: string
        description: A label for the study. This will be shown to users in emails and other contexts.
    sponsorName:
        type: string
        description: The name of the institution or organization that is conducting the study. 
    supportEmail:
        type: string
        description: |
            The email address that will be given to study participants and other end user for all support 
            requests and queries (technical, study-related, etc.). This can be a comma-separated list of email addresses. 
            Email will be sent via this email address.  
    technicalEmail:
        type: string
        description: |
            The email address for a technical contact who can coordinate with the Bridge Server team on technical 
            issues (client or server). This can be a comma-separated list of email addresses.
    consentNotificationEmail:
        type: string
        description: |
            Copies of all consent agreements, as well as rosters of all participants in a study, or any other study 
            governance issues, will be emailed to this address. This can be a comma-separated list of email addresses.
    identifier:
        type: string
        description: |
            A user selected identifier that is unique relative to all other Bridge studies (lower-case letters and dashes only). 
            The identifier serves as a "domain" that scopes accounts to that study, and is usually created by combining an 
            institution and study tag or acronym. For example, if you work at the University of Washington and your study is on 
            Asthma in Children, your identifier might be `uw-child-asthma`. Participants will not see this identifier.
    version:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: |
            A version number used for optimistic locking of the object these keys represent; this value must be passed 
            back to the server on updates. If the version doesn't match the version in the database, an error will be 
            returned (409 Conflict) and the study will not be saved. 
    minAgeOfConsent:
        type: integer
        default: 18
        description: |
            The minimum required age for participants in the study. If the user reports they are younger than this age, they will not be allowed to consent to the research.
    synapseDataAccessTeamId:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: |
            Synapse team ID that is granted read access to exported health data records.
    synapseProjectId:
        type: string
        description: The Synapse project to export health data records to.
    usesCustomExportSchedule:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Note: Bridge engineers will normally set this value when setting up data export. You should probably leave this 
            setting as is.** By default, all studies are exported using the default nightly schedule. Some studies may need 
            custom schedules for hourly or on-demand exports. To prevent this study from being exported twice (once by the 
            custom schedule, once by the default schedule), you should set this attribute to true.
    userProfileAttributes:
        type: array
        description: |
            Custom attributes that can be added to the StudyParticipant object (as members of the attributes property). For 
            example, if you wished to collect a telephone number for participants and had permission to do so, you could add 
            the "telephone" attribute. The map of a user's profile attributes can be personally identifying health information; 
            it will be stored encrypted and in a separate data store from the participant's health data.
        items:
            type: string
    taskIdentifiers:
        type: array
        description: |
            An enumerated list of **unique** strings that can be used to identify tasks when creating schedules. These mostly 
            serve to prevent typos when designing schedules, which would prevent client scheduling from working. There's no hard 
            limit on the string content (e.g. "Tapping Test" is fine as a task identifier, as long as it uniquely identifies a 
            task known to the application).
        items:
            type: string
    dataGroups:
        type: array
        description: |
            An enumerated list of **unique** strings that can be assigned to user accounts. This is a list of the "tags" that 
            can be assigned to a given user. The specific data groups that *are* assigned to a user will be exported with a 
            participant's health data to Synapse. This can be used to identify test users or specific cohorts in the study, but 
            it should not include sensitive health information about participants. Strings must contain only letters, numbers, 
            underscore or dash, and cannot (as a comma-separated list) exceed the character limit of 100 characters so they 
            can be exported to Synapse.
        items:
            type: string
    passwordPolicy:
        description: |
            Settings that will govern what is accepted as a valid password when users sign up for the study. If not included, the password policy will default to requiring 8 characters, including lower and upper-case letters, at least one number and at least one symbol.
        $ref: ./password_policy.yml
    verifyEmailTemplate:
        description: |
            The template for emails delivered to users during sign up, asking them to verify their email address.
        $ref: ./email_template.yml
    resetPasswordTemplate:
        description: The template for emails delivered to users who ask to reset their passwords.
        $ref: ./email_template.yml
    active:
        type: boolean
        readOnly: true
    strictUploadValidationEnabled:
        description: True if uploads in this study should fail on strict validation errors.
        type: boolean
    healthCodeExportEnabled:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Can be edited by admins.** Should user health codes be exported as part of the participant roster? This identifies users in the public data set; this can only be set to true for certain studies where users expect to be identified by researchers.
    emailVerificationEnabled:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Can be edited by admins.** Should users be asked to validate that they control the email addresses they use to sign up for the study? True by default.
    externalIdValidationEnabled:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            Should external identifiers be validated? If this is false, then the external ID is treated as an unconstrained string. If this is true, the study designer will need to enter the list of valid codes into Bridge. Bridge will ensure that the following is true:

            * Accounts cannot be created without including an externalId;
            * When assigned, the ID will have to match one of the IDs entered into Bridge;
            * A given ID will be assigned to one and only one user;
            * Once assigned, it is not possible to change or remove the external ID from the user account.
    minSupportedAppVersions:
        type: object
        description: |
            Minimum supported app versions (older versions will be blocked), keyed by the 
            name of the operating system (we expect either "Android" or "iPhone OS" in the 
            User-Agent header of all requests sent to the server). Example: `{"iPhone OS":14,"Android":10}`
