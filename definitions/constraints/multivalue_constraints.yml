    User must select a response from a list of options (however the question can allow for a 
    free-form "other" value to be provided instead if the user wishes). This is common question 
    type with many possible UI renderings, but the constraints can help to limit the choices:

                true if the user should be able to enter another value besides those provided in the
                enumeration, false otherwise. If set to true, then the user's answer must be of the 
                right data type, but no other validation occurs.

                values, false otherwise.
